* Worms on "planets" in rotateable 2D
* maybe more than one planet per map
* The basic map is a 2D pixel map, however rotated most of the times
* Every pixel "dirt" has a fix position and gravity. The gravitation at every
	point in the system is calculated as sum of all forces
	* Force lookup map for every pixel in the system
	* When a couple of pixels is removed / added the forces are subtracted from
		the lookup map
	* Pro:
		* Really fast gravitation calculation based on the position
		* Fast visualization of the gravitation field
	* Contra:
		* Big memory use. E.g: a 1000x1000 Pixel map needs ~ 2 MB Pixel space and
			8 MB (2*4Byte for the two directions in 2D) gravitation lookup.
* ALL levels are created automaticly based on (rotated) shapes like ellipses,
	rectangles and triangles.
* Some pixels have more/fewer mass than others.
* Destroyed pixels fly away => gravity decreased over time
* Jumping and Co depends on the gravity
* Simple skeletons (like XKCD) for player pixel"art"
	* maybe drawing just outlines
* zoom via mame2x
* Weapons
	* Bazooka
	* Grenade
	* Split Grenade
	* Space shuttle (like aero plane), the map rotates!
	* Digger / heat burner
	* Baseball bat
	* super peanut (flying)
	* Pistol
	* Rope
	* Fart bomb
	* Teleport
	* Mine
	* Building stuff
	* Dynamite
* Environment:
	* Wind
	* Gravity (s.a.)
	* Minen
